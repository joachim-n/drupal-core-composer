**OBSOLETE**

New version is at https://github.com/joachim-n/drupal-core-development-project

This is a Composer template for developing Drupal core.

It allows:

- a clean git clone of Drupal core.
- Composer dependencies of Drupal core are installed, so Drupal can be installed
  and run as normal.
- other Composer packages you might want, such as Drush, Devel module, and Admin
  Toolbar module, can be installed too, but don't affect the composer files
  that are part of Drupal core.

## Instructions

### Installation

Clone this repo into, say, 'drupal-dev'.

```
$ cd drupal-dev

# Create a folder in which to store git clones, which Composer will symlink in.
$ mkdir repos
$ cd repos

# Clone Drupal core, to whatever branch you like.
$ git clone --branch 9.2.x https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git

# Go back to the project root.
$ cd ..

# Install packages with Composer.
$ composer install
```

The Drupal core git clone will be clean apart from:

```
	sites/default/settings.php
	vendor
```

Since it doesn't have a .gitignore at the top level, you can add one to ignore
those files if you like.

### Running tests

The following are required to run tests.

#### PHPUnit configuration

The simplest way to run tests with this setup is to put the phpunit.xml file in the project root and then run tests from there:

$ vendor/bin/phpunit web/core/PATH-TO-TEST-FILE/TestFile.php

To set this up, copy Drupal core's sample phpunit.xml file to the project root:

$ cp web/core/phpunit.xml.dist phpunit.xml

Then change the `bootstrap` attribute so the path is correct:

```
<phpunit bootstrap="web/core/tests/bootstrap.php"
```

## How it works

The composer.json at the project root uses a Composer path repository so that when the drupal/drupal package is installed, it's symlinked in from the Drupal core git clone, at the branch that the clone has checked out.

Drupal core itself defines path repositories in its top-level composer.json. These need to be overridden in the project root composer.json so they point to inside the Drupal core git clone.

## Limitations

Most Drush commands work, but `drush cr` does *not*. To rebuild, install Devel module and use that instead.

For a fix, see https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/1792310.

## Workarounds

Several workarounds are necessary to make Drupal core work correctly when symlinked into the project. These are all taken care of by Composer scripts during installation. Details are below.

### Vendor folder

The vendor folder has to be symlinked into the Drupal core repository, because otherwise code in core that expects to find a Composer autoloader fails.

This is done by a Composer script after initial installation. The manual command
is:

```
ln -s ../../vendor ./repos/drupal/vendor
```

### App root index.php patch

The index.php scaffold file has to be patched after it has been copied to web/index.php, because otherwise DrupalKernel guesses the Drupal app root as incorrectly being inside the Drupal core git clone, which means it can't find the settings.php file.

This is done by a Composer script after initial installation. The manual command
is:

```
cd web && patch -p1 <../scaffold/scaffold-patch-index-php.patch
```

See https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3188703 for more detail.

### Simpletest folder

When running browser tests, the initial setup of Drupal in FunctionalTestSetupTrait::prepareEnvironment() creates a site folder using the real file locations with symlinks resolved, thus `repos/drupal/sites/simpletest`, but during the request to the test site, Drupal looks in `/web/sites/simpletest`.

Additionally, the HTML files output from Browser tests are written into the Drupal core git clone, and so the URLs shown in PHPUnit output are incorrect.

The fix for both of these is to create the simpletest site folder in the web root and symlink it into the Drupal core git clone.

This is done by a Composer script after initial installation. The manual command
is:

```
mkdir -p web/sites/simpletest
ln -s ../../../web/sites/simpletest repos/drupal/sites
```
